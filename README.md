## Text-Clustering
This repository is for text clustering done on News Records by implementing DBSCAN algorithm from scratch using Numpy, pandas and matplotlib. I have also used Dimensionality reduction on the highly sparse training data, which was 50% of the entire data, to develop the model.
This model achieved 0.4 approx NMI score on the entire data.
